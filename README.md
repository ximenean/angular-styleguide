# Angular Style Guide

*Opinionated Angular style guide for Element teams. This styleguide is based on the Angular styleguide created by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Element applications by showing the conventions we use and, more importantly, why we chose them.

## Single Responsibility

### Rule of 1
###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

  - Define 1 component per file.

  The following example defines the `app` module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute'])
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController)
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  class SomeController() { }

  class someFactory() { }
  ```

  The same components are now separated into their own files.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // app.module.js
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute']);
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // someController.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  class SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // someFactory.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  class someFactory() { }
  ```

## Modules

### Avoid Naming Collisions
###### [Style [Y020](#style-y020)]

  - Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules.

  *Why?*: Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. For example `app` may be your root module while `app.dashboard` and `app.users` may be modules that are used as dependencies of `app`.

### Definitions (aka Setters)
###### [Style [Y021](#style-y021)]

  - Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.

  *Why?*: With 1 component per file, there is rarely a need to introduce a variable for the module.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app', [
      'ngAnimate',
      'ngRoute',
      'app.shared',
      'app.dashboard'
  ]);
  ```

  Instead use the simple setter syntax.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app', [
          'ngAnimate',
          'ngRoute',
          'app.shared',
          'app.dashboard'
      ]);
  ```

### Getters
###### [Style [Y022](#style-y022)]

  - When using a module, avoid using a variable and instead use chaining with the getter syntax.

  *Why?*: This produces more readable code and avoids variable collisions or leaks.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app');
  app.controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  class SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  class SomeController() { }
  ```

### Setting vs Getting
###### [Style [Y023](#style-y023)]

  - Only set once and get for all other instances.

  *Why?*: A module should only be created once, then retrieved from that point and after.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // to set a module
  angular.module('app', []);

  // to get a module
  angular.module('app');
  ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Controllers

### controllerAs View Syntax
###### [Style [Y030](#style-y030)]

  - Use the [`controllerAs`](http://www.johnpapa.net/do-you-like-your-angular-controllers-with-or-without-sugar/) syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.

  *Why?*: Controllers are constructed, "newed" up, and provide a single new instance, and the `controllerAs` syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the `classic $scope syntax`.

  *Why?*: It promotes the use of binding to a "dotted" object in the View (e.g. `customer.name` instead of `name`), which is more contextual, easier to read, and avoids any reference issues that may occur without "dotting".

  *Why?*: Helps avoid using `$parent` calls in Views with nested controllers.

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <div ng-controller="Customer">
      {{ name }}
  </div>
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <div ng-controller="Customer as customer">
      {{ customer.name }}
  </div>
  ```

### controllerAs Controller Syntax
###### [Style [Y031](#style-y031)]

  - Use the `controllerAs` syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.

  - The `controllerAs` syntax uses `this` inside controllers which gets bound to `$scope`

  *Why?*: `controllerAs` is syntactic sugar over `$scope`. You can still bind to the View and still access `$scope` methods.

  *Why?*: Helps avoid the temptation of using `$scope` methods inside a controller when it may otherwise be better to avoid them or move the method to a factory, and reference them from the controller. Consider using `$scope` in a controller only when needed. For example when publishing and subscribing events using [`$emit`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$emit), [`$broadcast`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$broadcast), or [`$on`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$on) consider moving these uses to a factory and invoke from the controller.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  class Customer {
    
    public static $inject = ['$scope'];
    
    constructor($scope){
      $scope.name = {};
      $scope.sendMessage = this.sendMessage;
    }
    
    sendMessage() {}
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  class Customer {
    
    constructor(){
      this.name = {};
    }
    
    sendMessage() {}
  }
  ```

### Defer Controller Logic to Services
###### [Style [Y035](#style-y035)]

  - Defer logic in a controller by delegating to services and factories.

    *Why?*: Logic may be reused by multiple controllers when placed within a service and exposed via a function.

    *Why?*: Logic in a service can more easily be isolated in a unit test, while the calling logic in the controller can be easily mocked.

    *Why?*: Removes dependencies and hides implementation details from the controller.

    *Why?*: Keeps the controller slim, trim, and focused.

  ```javascript

  /* avoid */
  class Order {
    
    public static $inject = ['$http'];
    
    public isCreditOk: boolean = false;
    public total: number = 0;
    
    constructor(private $http) {
    }

    checkCredit() {
          var settings = {};
          // Get the credit service base URL from config
          // Set credit service required headers
          // Prepare URL query string or data object with request data
          // Add user-identifying info so service gets the right credit limit for this user.
          // Use JSONP for this browser if it doesn't support CORS
          return this.$http.get(settings)
              .then((data) => {
               // Unpack JSON data in the response object
                 // to find maxRemainingAmount
                 this.isCreditOk = this.total <= maxRemainingAmount
              })
              .catch((error) => {
                 // Interpret error
                 // Cope w/ timeout? retry? try alternate service?
                 // Re-reject with appropriate error for a user to see
              });
      };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  class Order() {
    
    public static $inject = ['creditService'];
    
    public isCreditOk: boolean = false;
    public total: number = 0;
    
    constructor(private creditService) {
    }
    
    checkCredit() {
         return this.creditService.isOrderTotalOk(this.total)
            .then((isOk) => { this.isCreditOk = isOk; })
            .catch(showError);
    };
  }
  ```

### Keep Controllers Focused
###### [Style [Y037](#style-y037)]

  - Define a controller for a view, and try not to reuse the controller for other views. Instead, move reusable logic to factories and keep the controller simple and focused on its view.

    *Why?*: Reusing controllers with several views is brittle and good end-to-end (e2e) test coverage is required to ensure stability across large applications.

### Assigning Controllers
###### [Style [Y038](#style-y038)]

  - When a controller must be paired with a view and either component may be re-used by other controllers or views, define controllers along with their routes.

    Note: If a View is loaded via another means besides a route, then use the `ng-controller="Avengers as vm"` syntax.

    *Why?*: Pairing the controller in the route allows different routes to invoke different pairs of controllers and views. When controllers are assigned in the view using [`ng-controller`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngController), that view is always associated with the same controller.

 ```javascript
  /* avoid - when using with a route and dynamic pairing is desired */

  // route-config.ts
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($stateProvider) {
      $stateProvider
          .state('/avengers', {
            templateUrl: 'avengers.html'
          });
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- avengers.html -->
  <div ng-controller="Avengers as vm">
  </div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // route-config.ts
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($stateProvider) {
      $stateProvider
          .state('/avengers', {
              templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
              controller: 'Avengers',
              controllerAs: 'vm'
          });
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- avengers.html -->
  <div>
  </div>
  ```

## Services

### Singletons
###### [Style [Y040](#style-y040)]

  - Services are instantiated with the `new` keyword, use `this` for public methods and variables. Since services and factories are so similar and services align with Typescript classes, use a service over a factory.

    Note: [All Angular services are singletons](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services). This means that there is only one instance of a given service per injector.

  ```javascript
  // service
  angular
      .module('app')
      .service('logger', logger);

  class logger {
    
    logError(msg) {
      /* */
    };
  }
  ```

### Single Responsibility
###### [Style [Y050](#style-y050)]

  - Services should have a [single responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is encapsulated by its context. Once a service begins to exceed that singular purpose, a new service should be created.


**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Data Services

### Separate Data Calls
###### [Style [Y060](#style-y060)]

  - Refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a service. Make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.

    *Why?*: The controller's responsibility is for the presentation and gathering of information for the view. It should not care how it gets the data, just that it knows who to ask for it. Separating the data services moves the logic on how to get it to the data service, and lets the controller be simpler and more focused on the view.

    *Why?*: This makes it easier to test (mock or real) the data calls when testing a controller that uses a data service.

    *Why?*: Data service implementation may have very specific code to handle the data repository. This may include headers, how to talk to the data, or other services such as `$http`. Separating the logic into a data service encapsulates this logic in a single place hiding the implementation from the outside consumers (perhaps a controller), also making it easier to change the implementation.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // dataservice factory
  angular
      .module('app.core')
      .service('dataservice', dataservice);
      
  class dataService {

    public static $inject = ['$http', 'logger'];
  
    constructor dataservice(private $http, private logger) {

    }

    getAvengers() {
       return this.$http.get('/api/maa')
              .then(this.getAvengersComplete)
              .catch(this.getAvengersFailed);

    getAvengersComplete(response) {
      return response.data.results;
    }

    getAvengersFailed(error) {
      this.logger.error('XHR Failed for getAvengers.' + error.data);
    }
    
  }
  ```

    Note: The data service is called from consumers, such as a controller, hiding the implementation from the consumers, as shown below.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // controller calling the dataservice factory
  angular
      .module('app.avengers')
      .controller('Avengers', Avengers);

  
  class Avengers {
    
    private avengers : Array<IAvenger>;
    
    Avengers.$inject = ['dataservice', 'logger'];

    constructor Avengers(dataservice, logger) {
        this.avengers = [];
        this.activate();
    }

    activate() {
          return this.getAvengers().then(() => {
              this.logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
          });
      }

    getAvengers() {
          return this.dataservice.getAvengers()
              .then((data) => {
                  this.avengers = data;
                  return this.avengers;
                });
     }
  }
  ```

### Return a Promise from Data Calls
###### [Style [Y061](#style-y061)]

  - When calling a data service that returns a promise such as `$http`, return a promise in your calling function too.

    *Why?*: You can chain the promises together and take further action after the data call completes and resolves or rejects the promise.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  activate() {
      /**
       * Step 1
       * Ask the getAvengers function for the
       * avenger data and wait for the promise
       */
      return this.getAvengers().then(() => {
          /**
           * Step 4
           * Perform an action on resolve of final promise
           */
          this.logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
      });
  }

  getAvengers() {
        /**
         * Step 2
         * Ask the data service for the data and wait
         * for the promise
         */
        return this.dataservice.getAvengers()
            .then((data) => {
                /**
                 * Step 3
                 * set the data and resolve the promise
                 */
                this.avengers = data;
                return this.avengers;
        });
  }
  ```

## Directives
### Limit 1 Per File
###### [Style [Y070](#style-y070)]

  - Create one directive per file. Name the file for the directive.

    *Why?*: It is easy to mash all the directives in one file, but difficult to then break those out so some are shared across apps, some across modules, some just for one module.

    *Why?*: One directive per file is easy to maintain.

    > Note: "**Best Practice**: Directives should clean up after themselves. You can use `element.on('$destroy', ...)` or `scope.$on('$destroy', ...)` to run a clean-up function when the directive is removed" ... from the Angular documentation.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  /* directives.ts */

  angular
      .module('app.widgets')

      /* order directive that is specific to the order module */
      .directive('orderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange)

      /* sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app */
      .directive('salesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo)

      /* spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps */
      .directive('sharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* index.ts */

  /**
   * @desc order directive that is specific to the order module
   * @example <div jhc-order-calendar-range></div>
   */
  
  import orderCalendarRange = require('./order-calendar-range');
  
  
  angular
      .module('sales.order')
      .directive('jhcOrderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange);
      .directive('jhcSalesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo);
      
  ```
  
  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* order-calendar-range-directive.ts */

  /**
  * @desc order directive that is specific to the order module at a company named Acme
  * @example <div acme-order-calendar-range></div>
  */
  var directive = [() => {
      /* implementation details */
  }]
  
  export = directive;
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* customer-info-directive.ts */

  /**
   * @desc sales directive that can be used anywhere across the app
   * @example <div jhc-sales-customer-info></div>
   */

  var directive = [() => {
      /* implementation details */
  }];
  
  export = directive;
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* spinner.directive.ts */

  /**
   * @desc spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps
   * @example <div jhc-shared-spinner></div>
   */
  var directive = [() => {
      /* implementation details */
  }];
  
  export = directive;
  ```

    Note: There are many naming options for directives, especially since they can be used in narrow or wide scopes. Choose one that makes the directive and its file name distinct and clear. Some examples are below, but see the [Naming](#naming) section for more recommendations.

### Manipulate DOM in a Directive
###### [Style [Y072](#style-y072)]

  - When manipulating the DOM directly, use a directive. If alternative ways can be used such as using CSS to set styles or the [animation services](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate), Angular templating, [`ngShow`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) or [`ngHide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide), then use those instead. For example, if the directive simply hides and shows, use ngHide/ngShow.

    *Why?*: DOM manipulation can be difficult to test, debug, and there are often better ways (e.g. CSS, animations, templates)

### Provide jhc as a Unique Directive Prefix
###### [Style [Y073](#style-y073)]

  - Provide jhc as a short, unique and descriptive directive prefix such as `jhcSalesCustomerInfo` which would be declared in HTML as `jhc-sales-customer-info`.

    *Why?*: The unique short prefix identifies the directive's context and origin.

### Restrict to Elements and Attributes
###### [Style [Y074](#style-y074)]

  - When creating a directive that makes sense as a stand-alone element, allow restrict `E` (custom element) and optionally restrict `A` (custom attribute). Generally, if it could be its own control, `E` is appropriate. General guideline is allow `EA` but lean towards implementing as an element when it's stand-alone and as an attribute when it enhances its existing DOM element.

    *Why?*: It makes sense.

    *Why?*: While we can allow the directive to be used as a class, if the directive is truly acting as an element it makes more sense as an element or at least as an attribute.

    Note: EA is the default for Angular 1.3 +

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <div class="my-calendar-range"></div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var directive = [() => {
      var directive = {
          link: link,
          templateUrl: '/template/is/located/here.html',
          restrict: 'C'
      };
      return directive;

      function link(scope, element, attrs) {
        /* */
      }
  }];
  
  export = directive;
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <my-calendar-range></my-calendar-range>
  <div my-calendar-range></div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  var directive = [ () => {
      var directive = {
          link: link,
          templateUrl: '/template/is/located/here.html',
          restrict: 'EA'
      };
      return directive;

      function link(scope, element, attrs) {
        /* */
      }
  }];
  
  export = directive;
  ```

### Directives and ControllerAs
###### [Style [Y075](#style-y075)]

  - Use `controller as` syntax with a directive to be consistent with using `controller as` with view and controller pairings.

    *Why?*: It makes sense and it's not difficult.

    Note: The directive below demonstrates some of the ways you can use scope inside of link and directive controllers, using controllerAs. I in-lined the template just to keep it all in one place.

    Note: Regarding dependency injection, see [Manually Identify Dependencies](#manual-annotating-for-dependency-injection).

  ```html
  <div my-example max="77"></div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* my-example-directive.ts */
  
  var directive = [() => {
      var directive = {
          restrict: 'EA',
          templateUrl: 'app/feature/example.directive.html',
          scope: {
              max: '='
          },
          link: linkFunc,
          controller: require('./my-example-controller'),
          controllerAs: 'vm',
          bindToController: true // because the scope is isolated
      };

      return directive;

      function linkFunc(scope, el, attr, ctrl) {
          console.log('LINK: scope.min = %s *** should be undefined', scope.min);
          console.log('LINK: scope.max = %s *** should be undefined', scope.max);
          console.log('LINK: scope.vm.min = %s', scope.vm.min);
          console.log('LINK: scope.vm.max = %s', scope.vm.max);
      }
  }];
  
  export = directive;
  ```
  
  ```javascript
  /* my-example-controller.ts */
  
  class ExampleController {
  
    public static $inject = ['$scope'];
    
    public min: number;
    public max: number;
  
    constructor($scope) {
        // Injecting $scope just for comparison
        this.min = 3;
  
        console.log('CTRL: $scope.vm.min = %s', $scope.vm.min);
        console.log('CTRL: $scope.vm.max = %s', $scope.vm.max);
        console.log('CTRL: vm.min = %s', vm.min);
        console.log('CTRL: vm.max = %s', vm.max);
    }
  }
  
  export = ExampleController;
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- example.directive.html -->
  <div>hello world</div>
  <div>max={{vm.max}}<input ng-model="vm.max"/></div>
  <div>min={{vm.min}}<input ng-model="vm.min"/></div>
  ```

    Note: You can also name the controller when you inject it into the link function and access directive attributes as properties of the controller.

  ```javascript
  // Alternative to above example
  function linkFunc(scope, el, attr, vm) {
      console.log('LINK: scope.min = %s *** should be undefined', scope.min);
      console.log('LINK: scope.max = %s *** should be undefined', scope.max);
      console.log('LINK: vm.min = %s', vm.min);
      console.log('LINK: vm.max = %s', vm.max);
  }
  ```

###### [Style [Y076](#style-y076)]

  - Use `bindToController = true` when using `controller as` syntax with a directive when you want to bind the outer scope to the directive's controller's scope.

    *Why?*: It makes it easy to bind outer scope to the directive's controller scope.

    Note: `bindToController` was introduced in Angular 1.3.0.

  ```html
  <div my-example max="77"></div>
  ```

  ```javascript

  var directive = [() => {
      var directive = {
          restrict: 'EA',
          templateUrl: 'app/feature/example.directive.html',
          scope: {
              max: '='
          },
          controller: require('./example-controller');
          controllerAs: 'vm',
          bindToController: true
      };

      return directive;
  }];
  
  export = directive;
  ```
  
  ```javascript
  /* my-example-controller.ts */
  
 class ExampleController {
    
    public min: number;
    public max: number;
    
    contructor() {
      
      console.log('CTRL: vm.min = %s', this.min);
      console.log('CTRL: vm.max = %s', this.max);
    }
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- example.directive.html -->
  <div>hello world</div>
  <div>max={{vm.max}}<input ng-model="vm.max"/></div>
  <div>min={{vm.min}}<input ng-model="vm.min"/></div>
  ```

## Resolving Promises for a Controller
### Controller Activation Promises
###### [Style [Y080](#style-y080)]

  - Resolve start-up logic for a controller in an `activate` function.

    *Why?*: Placing start-up logic in a consistent place in the controller makes it easier to locate, more consistent to test, and helps avoid spreading out the activation logic across the controller.

    *Why?*: The controller `activate` makes it convenient to re-use the logic for a refresh for the controller/View, keeps the logic together, gets the user to the View faster, makes animations easy on the `ng-view` or `ui-view`, and feels snappier to the user.

    Note: If you need to conditionally cancel the route before you start using the controller, use a [route resolve](#style-y081) instead.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  class Avengers {
    
    public avengers : Array<IAvenger>;
    public title: string;
    
    constructor(dataservice) {
      
      this.avengers = [];
      this.title = 'Avengers';

      dataservice.getAvengers().then((data) => {
          this.avengers = data;
          return data;
      });
    }
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  class Avengers {
    
    public avengers : Array<IAvenger>;
    public title: string;
    
    constructor Avengers(dataservice) {
    
      this.avengers = [];
      this.title = 'Avengers';

      this.activate();
    }

      ////////////

    activate() {
        return dataservice.getAvengers().then((data) => {
            this.avengers = data;
            return data;
        });
    }
  }
  ```

### State Resolve Promises
###### [Style [Y081](#style-y081)]

  - When a controller depends on a promise to be resolved before the controller is activated, resolve those dependencies in the `$stateProvider` before the controller logic is executed. If you need to conditionally cancel a route before the controller is activated, use a route resolver.

  - Use a route resolve when you want to decide to cancel the route before ever transitioning to the View.

    *Why?*: A controller may require data before it loads. That data may come from a promise via a custom factory or [$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http). Using a [route resolve](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider) allows the promise to resolve before the controller logic executes, so it might take action based on that data from the promise.

    *Why?*: The code executes after the route and in the controller’s activate function. The View starts to load right away. Data binding kicks in when the activate promise resolves. A “busy” animation can be shown during the view transition (via `ng-view` or `ui-view`)

    Note: The code executes before the route via a promise. Rejecting the promise cancels the route. Resolve makes the new view wait for the route to resolve. A “busy” animation can be shown before the resolve and through the view transition. If you want to get to the View faster and do not require a checkpoint to decide if you can get to the View, consider the [controller `activate` technique](#style-y080) instead.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('Avengers', Avengers);

    
  class Avengers {
    
    public movies: Array<IMovie>;
    
    public static $inject = ['movieService'];
    
    constructor(movieService) {
      
      // resolved asynchronously
      movieService.getMovies().then((response) => {
          this.movies = response.movies;
      });
    }
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* better */

  // route-config.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($stateProvider) {
      $stateProvider
          .state('/avengers', {
              templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
              controller: 'Avengers',
              controllerAs: 'vm',
              resolve: {
                  moviesPrepService: (movieService) => {
                      return movieService.getMovies();
                  }
              }
          });
  }

  // avengers.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('Avengers', Avengers);
      
  class Avengers {
    
    public movies: Array<IMovie>;

    public static $inject = ['moviesPrepService'];
    
    constructor(moviesPrepService) {
        this.movies = moviesPrepService.movies;
    }
  }
  ```

    Note: The example below shows the state resolve points to a named function, which is easier to debug and easier to handle dependency injection.

  ```javascript
  /* even better */

  // route-config.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  var config = ($stateProvider) => {
      $stateProvider
          .state('/avengers', {
              templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
              controller: 'Avengers',
              controllerAs: 'vm',
              resolve: {
                  moviesPrepService: moviesPrepService
              }
          });
  };

  var moviesPrepService = (movieService) => {
      return movieService.getMovies();
  };

  // avengers.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('Avengers', Avengers);

  class Avengers {
    
    public movies: Array<IMovie>;

    public static $inject = ['moviesPrepService'];
    
    constructor(moviesPrepService) {
        this.movies = moviesPrepService.movies;
    }
  }
  ```
    Note: The code example's dependency on `movieService` is not minification safe on its own. For details on how to make this code minification safe, see the sections on [dependency injection](#manual-annotating-for-dependency-injection) and on [minification and annotation](#minification-and-annotation).

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Manual Annotating for Dependency Injection

### UnSafe from Minification
###### [Style [Y090](#style-y090)]

  - Avoid using the shortcut syntax of declaring dependencies without using a minification-safe approach.

    *Why?*: The parameters to the component (e.g. controller, factory, etc) will be converted to mangled variables. For example, `common` and `dataservice` may become `a` or `b` and not be found by Angular.

    ```javascript
    /* avoid - not minification-safe*/
    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('Dashboard', Dashboard);

    function Dashboard(common, dataservice) {
    }
    ```

    This code may produce mangled variables when minified and thus cause runtime errors.

    ```javascript
    /* avoid - not minification-safe*/
    angular.module('app').controller('Dashboard', d);function d(a, b) { }
    ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**



## Naming

### Naming Guidelines
###### [Style [Y120](#style-y120)]

  - Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. The recommended pattern is `feature-type.ts`. There are 2 names for most assets:
    * the file name (`avengers-controller.js`)
    * the registered component name with Angular (`AvengersController`)

    *Why?*: Naming conventions help provide a consistent way to find content at a glance. Consistency within the project is vital. Consistency with a team is important. Consistency across a company provides tremendous efficiency.

    *Why?*: The naming conventions should simply help you find your code faster and make it easier to understand.

### Feature File Names
###### [Style [Y121](#style-y121)]

  - Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. The recommended pattern is `feature-type.ts`.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify components.

    *Why?*: Provides pattern matching for any automated tasks.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // controllers
    avengers-controller.ts
    __tests__/avengers-controller-spec.ts

    // services/factories
    logger-service.ts
    __tests__/logger-service-spec.ts

    // constants
    constants.ts

    // module definition
    module-name/index.ts

    // configuration
    avengers-config.ts

    // directives
    avenger-profile-directive.ts
    __tests__/avenger-profile-directive-spec.ts
    ```

### Test File Names
###### [Style [Y122](#style-y122)]

  - Name test specifications similar to the component they test with a suffix of `spec`.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify components.

    *Why?*: Provides pattern matching for [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) or other test runners.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */
    avengers-controller-spec.ts
    logger-service-spec.ts
    avenger-profile-directive-spec.ts
    ```

### Controller Names
###### [Style [Y123](#style-y123)]

  - Use consistent names for all controllers named after their feature. Use UpperCamelCase for controllers, as they are constructors.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference controllers.

    *Why?*: UpperCamelCase is conventional for identifying object that can be instantiated using a constructor.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // avengers.controller.js
    angular
        .module
        .controller('HeroAvengersController', HeroAvengersController);

    class HeroAvengersController { }
    ```

### Controller Name Suffix
###### [Style [Y124](#style-y124)]

  - Append the controller name with the suffix `Controller`.

    *Why?*: The `Controller` suffix is more commonly used and is more explicitly descriptive.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // avengers-controller.ts
    angular
        .module
        .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

    class AvengersController { }
    ```

### Factory and Service Names
###### [Style [Y125](#style-y125)]

  - Use consistent names for all factories and services named after their feature. Use camel-casing for services and factories. Avoid prefixing factories and services with `$`. Only suffix service and factories with `Service` when it is not clear what they are (i.e. when they are nouns).

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference factories.

    *Why?*: Avoids name collisions with built-in factories and services that use the `$` prefix.

    *Why?*: Clear service names such as `logger` do not require a suffix.

    *Why?*: Service names such as `avengers` are nouns and require a suffix and should be named `avengersService`.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // logger-service.ts
    angular
        .module
        .service('logger', logger);

    class logger { }
    ```

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // credit-service.ts
    angular
        .module
        .service('creditService', creditService);

    class creditService { }

    // customer.service.ts
    angular
        .module
        .service('customersService', customersService);

    class customersService { }
    ```

### Directive Component Names
###### [Style [Y126](#style-y126)]

  - Use consistent names for all directives using camel-case. Use a short prefix to describe the area that the directives belong (some example are company prefix or project prefix).

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference components.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // avenger-profile.directive.js
    angular
        .module
        .directive('jhcAvengerProfile', avengerProfile);

    // usage is <jhc-avenger-profile> </jhc-avenger-profile>

    function avengerProfile() { }
    ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Application Structure LIFT Principle
### LIFT
###### [Style [Y140](#style-y140)]

  - Structure your app such that you can `L`ocate your code quickly, `I`dentify the code at a glance, keep the `F`lattest structure you can, and `T`ry to stay DRY. The structure should follow these 4 basic guidelines.

    *Why LIFT?*: Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check your app structure is to ask yourself: How quickly can you open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

    When I find my structure is not feeling comfortable, I go back and revisit these LIFT guidelines

    1. `L`ocating our code is easy
    2. `I`dentify code at a glance
    3. `F`lat structure as long as we can
    4. `T`ry to stay DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY

### Locate
###### [Style [Y141](#style-y141)]

  - Make locating your code intuitive, simple and fast.

    *Why?*: I find this to be super important for a project. If the team cannot find the files they need to work on quickly, they will not be able to work as efficiently as possible, and the structure needs to change. You may not know the file name or where its related files are, so putting them in the most intuitive locations and near each other saves a ton of time. A descriptive folder structure can help with this.

    ```
    /bower_components
    /client
      /app
        /avengers
        /blocks
          /exception
          /logger
        /core
        /dashboard
        /data
        /layout
        /widgets
      /content
      index.html
    .bower.json
    ```

### Identify
###### [Style [Y142](#style-y142)]

  - When you look at a file you should instantly know what it contains and represents.

    *Why?*: You spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means you want longer file names, then so be it. Be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly 1 component. Avoid files with multiple controllers, multiple services, or a mixture. There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when I have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, they are still easily identifiable.

### Flat
###### [Style [Y143](#style-y143)]

  - Keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. When you get to 7+ files, begin considering separation.

    *Why?*: Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. Think about menus on web sites … anything deeper than 2 should take serious consideration. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. Base it on your comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.

### T-DRY (Try to Stick to DRY)
###### [Style [Y144](#style-y144)]

  - Be DRY, but don't go nuts and sacrifice readability.

    *Why?*: Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why I call it T-DRY. I don’t want to type session-view.html for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then I name it.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Application Structure

### Overall Guidelines
###### [Style [Y150](#style-y150)]

  - Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. In other words, start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. All of the app's code goes in a root folder named `app`. All content is 1 feature per file. Each controller, service, module, view is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the `app` folder. I didn't write them and I don't want them cluttering my app (`bower_components`, `scripts`, `lib`).

    Note: Find more details and reasoning behind the structure at [this original post on application structure](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/).

### Folders-by-Feature Structure
###### [Style [Y152](#style-y152)]

  - Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.

    *Why?*: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.

    *Why?*: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.

    *Why?*: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.

    *Why?*: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.

    ```

      ![Sample App Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/assets/modularity-2.png)

      Note: Do not structure your app using folders-by-type. This requires moving to multiple folders when working on a feature and gets unwieldy quickly as the app grows to 5, 10 or 25+ views and controllers (and other features), which makes it more difficult than folder-by-feature to locate files.

    ```javascript
    /*
    * avoid
    * Alternative folders-by-type.
    * I recommend "folders-by-feature", instead.
    */

## Modularity

### Many Small, Self Contained Modules
###### [Style [Y160](#style-y160)]

  - Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility.

    *Why?*: Modular applications make it easy to plug and go as they allow the development teams to build vertical slices of the applications and roll out incrementally. This means we can plug in new features as we develop them.

### Create an App Module
###### [Style [Y161](#style-y161)]

  - Create an application root module whose role is pull together all of the modules and features of your application. Name this for your application.

    *Why?*: Angular encourages modularity and separation patterns. Creating an application root module whose role is to tie your other modules together provides a very straightforward way to add or remove modules from your application.

### Keep the App Module Thin
###### [Style [Y162](#style-y162)]

  - Only put logic for pulling together the app in the application module. Leave features in their own modules.

    *Why?*: Adding additional roles to the application root to get remote data, display views, or other logic not related to pulling the app together muddies the app module and make both sets of features harder to reuse or turn off.

    *Why?*: The app module becomes a manifest that describes which modules help define the application.

### Feature Areas are Modules
###### [Style [Y163](#style-y163)]

  - Create modules that represent feature areas, such as layout, reusable and shared services, dashboards, and app specific features (e.g. customers, admin, sales).

    *Why?*: Self contained modules can be added to the application with little or no friction.

    *Why?*: Sprints or iterations can focus on feature areas and turn them on at the end of the sprint or iteration.

    *Why?*: Separating feature areas into modules makes it easier to test the modules in isolation and reuse code.

### Reusable Blocks are Modules
###### [Style [Y164](#style-y164)]

  - Create modules that represent reusable application blocks for common services such as exception handling, logging, diagnostics, security, and local data stashing.

    *Why?*: These types of features are needed in many applications, so by keeping them separated in their own modules they can be application generic and be reused across applications.

### Module Dependencies
###### [Style [Y165](#style-y165)]

  - The application root module depends on the app specific feature modules and any shared or reusable modules.

    ![Modularity and Dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/assets/modularity-1.png)

    *Why?*: The main app module contains a quickly identifiable manifest of the application's features.

    *Why?*: Each feature area contains a manifest of what it depends on, so it can be pulled in as a dependency in other applications and still work.

    *Why?*: Intra-App features such as shared data services become easy to locate and share from within `app.core` (choose your favorite name for this module).

    Note: This is a strategy for consistency. There are many good options here. Choose one that is consistent, follows Angular's dependency rules, and is easy to maintain and scale.

    > My structures vary slightly between projects but they all follow these guidelines for structure and modularity. The implementation may vary depending on the features and the team. In other words, don't get hung up on an exact like-for-like structure but do justify your structure using consistency, maintainability, and efficiency in mind.

    > In a small app, you can also consider putting all the shared dependencies in the app module where the feature modules have no direct dependencies. This makes it easier to maintain the smaller application, but makes it harder to reuse modules outside of this application.

## Startup Logic

### Configuration
###### [Style [Y170](#style-y170)]

  - Inject code into [module configuration](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies) that must be configured before running the angular app. Ideal candidates include providers and constants.

    *Why?*: This makes it easier to have less places for configuration.

  ```javascript
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(configure);

  var configure = ['routerHelperProvider', 'exceptionHandlerProvider', 'toastr', (routerHelperProvider, exceptionHandlerProvider, toastr) {
      exceptionHandlerProvider.configure(config.appErrorPrefix);
      configureStateHelper();

      toastr.options.timeOut = 4000;
      toastr.options.positionClass = 'toast-bottom-right';

      ////////////////

      var configureStateHelper = [() => {
          routerHelperProvider.configure({
              docTitle: 'NG-Modular: '
          });
      }];
  }];
  ```

### Run Blocks
###### [Style [Y171](#style-y171)]

  - Any code that needs to run when an application starts should be declared in a factory, exposed via a function, and injected into the [run block](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies).

    *Why?*: Code directly in a run block can be difficult to test. Placing in a factory makes it easier to abstract and mock.

  ```javascript
  angular
      .module('app')
      .run(runBlock);

  var runBlock = ['authenticator', 'translator', (authenticator, translator) => {
      authenticator.initialize();
      translator.initialize();
  }];
  ```

## Angular $ Wrapper Services

### $document and $window
###### [Style [Y180](#style-y180)]

  - Use [`$document`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$document) and [`$window`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$window) instead of `document` and `window`.

    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable than using document and window in tests. This helps you avoid having to mock document and window yourself.

### $timeout and $interval
###### [Style [Y181](#style-y181)]

  - Use [`$timeout`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout) and [`$interval`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$interval) instead of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` .

    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable and handle Angular's digest cycle thus keeping data binding in sync.

## Testing

Best practice guides for unit and e2e testing in Element can be found here [Unit testing](http://jhcwiki.jhc.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Element_Unit_Testing) and here [Protractor testing](http://jhcwiki.jhc.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Element_Protractor_Testing)

### Write Tests with Stories
###### [Style [Y190](#style-y190)]

  - Write a set of tests for every story. Start with an empty test and fill them in as you write the code for the story.

    *Why?*: Writing the test descriptions helps clearly define what your story will do, will not do, and how you can measure success.

    ```javascript
    it('should have Avengers controller', function() {
        // TODO
    });

    it('should find 1 Avenger when filtered by name', function() {
        // TODO
    });

    it('should have 10 Avengers', function() {
        // TODO (mock data?)
    });

    it('should return Avengers via XHR', function() {
        // TODO ($httpBackend?)
    });

    // and so on
    ```

## Animations

### Usage
###### [Style [Y210](#style-y210)]

  - Use subtle [animations with Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/animations) to transition between states for views and primary visual elements. Include the [ngAnimate module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate). The 3 keys are subtle, smooth, seamless.

    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve User Experience when used appropriately.

    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve perceived performance as views transition.

### Sub Second
###### [Style [Y211](#style-y211)]

  - Use short durations for animations. I generally start with 300ms and adjust until appropriate.

    *Why?*: Long animations can have the reverse affect on User Experience and perceived performance by giving the appearance of a slow application.

## Comments

### jsDoc
###### [Style [Y220](#style-y220)]

  - If planning to produce documentation, use [`jsDoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) syntax to document function names, description, params and returns. Use `@namespace` and `@memberOf` to match your app structure.

    *Why?*: You can generate (and regenerate) documentation from your code, instead of writing it from scratch.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency using a common industry tool.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Logger Factory
     * @namespace Factories
     */
      angular
          .module('app')
          .service('logger', logger);

      /**
       * @namespace Logger
       * @desc Application wide logger
       * @memberOf Factories
       */
       class Logger {

         public static $inject = ['$log'];

         constructor(private $log: ng.ILogService) {
         }

         /**
         * @name logError
         * @desc Logs errors
         * @param {String} msg Message to log
         * @returns {String}
         * @memberOf Factories.Logger
         */
         LogError(msg: string): string {

              var loggedMsg = 'Error: ' + msg;
              this.$log.error(loggedMsg);
              return loggedMsg;
         }
      }

    export = Logger;

    ```

## Filters

###### [Style [Y420](#style-y420)]

  - Avoid using filters for scanning all properties of a complex object graph. Use filters for select properties.

    *Why?*: Filters can easily be abused and negatively affect performance if not used wisely, for example when a filter hits a large and deep object graph.
