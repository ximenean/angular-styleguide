### Manually Identify Dependencies
###### [Style [Y091](#style-y091)]

  - Use `$inject` to manually identify your dependencies for Angular components.

    *Why?*: This technique mirrors the technique used by [`ng-annotate`](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate), which I recommend for automating the creation of minification safe dependencies. If `ng-annotate` detects injection has already been made, it will not duplicate it.

    *Why?*: This safeguards your dependencies from being vulnerable to minification issues when parameters may be mangled. For example, `common` and `dataservice` may become `a` or `b` and not be found by Angular.

    *Why?*: Avoid creating in-line dependencies as long lists can be difficult to read in the array. Also it can be confusing that the array is a series of strings while the last item is the component's function.

    ```javascript
    /* avoid */
    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('Dashboard',
            ['$location', '$routeParams', 'common', 'dataservice',
                function Dashboard($location, $routeParams, common, dataservice) {}
            ]);
    ```

    ```javascript
    /* avoid */
    angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('Dashboard',
          ['$location', '$routeParams', 'common', 'dataservice', Dashboard]);

    function Dashboard($location, $routeParams, common, dataservice) {
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('Dashboard', Dashboard);

    Dashboard.$inject = ['$location', '$routeParams', 'common', 'dataservice'];

    function Dashboard($location, $routeParams, common, dataservice) {
    }
    ```

    Note: When your function is below a return statement the `$inject` may be unreachable (this may happen in a directive). You can solve this by moving the Controller outside of the directive.

    ```javascript
    /* avoid */
    // inside a directive definition
    function outer() {
        var ddo = {
            controller: DashboardPanelController,
            controllerAs: 'vm'
        };
        return ddo;

        DashboardPanelController.$inject = ['logger']; // Unreachable
        function DashboardPanelController(logger) {
        }
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    // outside a directive definition
    function outer() {
        var ddo = {
            controller: DashboardPanelController,
            controllerAs: 'vm'
        };
        return ddo;
    }

    DashboardPanelController.$inject = ['logger'];
    function DashboardPanelController(logger) {
    }
    ```

### Manually Identify Route Resolver Dependencies
###### [Style [Y092](#style-y092)]

  - Use `$inject` to manually identify your route resolver dependencies for Angular components.

    *Why?*: This technique breaks out the anonymous function for the route resolver, making it easier to read.

    *Why?*: An `$inject` statement can easily precede the resolver to handle making any dependencies minification safe.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    function config($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider
            .when('/avengers', {
                templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
                controller: 'AvengersController',
                controllerAs: 'vm',
                resolve: {
                    moviesPrepService: moviesPrepService
                }
            });
    }

    moviesPrepService.$inject = ['movieService'];
    function moviesPrepService(movieService) {
        return movieService.getMovies();
    }
    ```

## Minification and Annotation

### ng-annotate
###### [Style [Y100](#style-y100)]

  - Use [ng-annotate](//github.com/olov/ng-annotate) for [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and comment functions that need automated dependency injection using `/* @ngInject */`

    *Why?*: This safeguards your code from any dependencies that may not be using minification-safe practices.

    *Why?*: [`ng-min`](https://github.com/btford/ngmin) is deprecated

    >I prefer Gulp as I feel it is easier to write, to read, and to debug.

    The following code is not using minification safe dependencies.

    ```javascript
    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('Avengers', Avengers);

    /* @ngInject */
    function Avengers(storage, avengerService) {
        var vm = this;
        vm.heroSearch = '';
        vm.storeHero = storeHero;

        function storeHero() {
            var hero = avengerService.find(vm.heroSearch);
            storage.save(hero.name, hero);
        }
    }
    ```

    When the above code is run through ng-annotate it will produce the following output with the `$inject` annotation and become minification-safe.

    ```javascript
    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('Avengers', Avengers);

    /* @ngInject */
    function Avengers(storage, avengerService) {
        var vm = this;
        vm.heroSearch = '';
        vm.storeHero = storeHero;

        function storeHero() {
            var hero = avengerService.find(vm.heroSearch);
            storage.save(hero.name, hero);
        }
    }

    Avengers.$inject = ['storage', 'avengerService'];
    ```

    Note: If `ng-annotate` detects injection has already been made (e.g. `@ngInject` was detected), it will not duplicate the `$inject` code.

    Note: When using a route resolver you can prefix the resolver's function with `/* @ngInject */` and it will produce properly annotated code, keeping any injected dependencies minification safe.

    ```javascript
    // Using @ngInject annotations
    function config($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider
            .when('/avengers', {
                templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
                controller: 'Avengers',
                controllerAs: 'vm',
                resolve: { /* @ngInject */
                    moviesPrepService: function(movieService) {
                        return movieService.getMovies();
                    }
                }
            });
    }
    ```

    > Note: Starting from Angular 1.3 you can use the [`ngApp`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp) directive's `ngStrictDi` parameter to detect any potentially missing minification safe dependencies. When present the injector will be created in "strict-di" mode causing the application to fail to invoke functions which do not use explicit function annotation (these may not be minification safe). Debugging info will be logged to the console to help track down the offending code. I prefer to only use `ng-strict-di` for debugging purposes only.
    `<body ng-app="APP" ng-strict-di>`

### Use Gulp or Grunt for ng-annotate
###### [Style [Y101](#style-y101)]

  - Use [gulp-ng-annotate](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-ng-annotate) or [grunt-ng-annotate](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-ng-annotate) in an automated build task. Inject `/* @ngInject */` prior to any function that has dependencies.

    *Why?*: ng-annotate will catch most dependencies, but it sometimes requires hints using the `/* @ngInject */` syntax.

    The following code is an example of a gulp task using ngAnnotate

    ```javascript
    gulp.task('js', ['jshint'], function() {
        var source = pkg.paths.js;

        return gulp.src(source)
            .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
            .pipe(concat('all.min.js', {newLine: ';'}))
            // Annotate before uglify so the code get's min'd properly.
            .pipe(ngAnnotate({
                // true helps add where @ngInject is not used. It infers.
                // Doesn't work with resolve, so we must be explicit there
                add: true
            }))
            .pipe(bytediff.start())
            .pipe(uglify({mangle: true}))
            .pipe(bytediff.stop())
            .pipe(sourcemaps.write('./'))
            .pipe(gulp.dest(pkg.paths.dev));
    });

    ```
    
    

## Exception Handling

### decorators
###### [Style [Y110](#style-y110)]

  - Use a [decorator](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$provide#decorator), at config time using the [`$provide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$provide) service, on the [`$exceptionHandler`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$exceptionHandler) service to perform custom actions when exceptions occur.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to handle uncaught Angular exceptions for development-time or run-time.

    Note: Another option is to override the service instead of using a decorator. This is a fine option, but if you want to keep the default behavior and extend it a decorator is recommended.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    angular
        .module('blocks.exception')
        .config(exceptionConfig);

    exceptionConfig.$inject = ['$provide'];

    function exceptionConfig($provide) {
        $provide.decorator('$exceptionHandler', extendExceptionHandler);
    }

    extendExceptionHandler.$inject = ['$delegate', 'toastr'];

    function extendExceptionHandler($delegate, toastr) {
        return function(exception, cause) {
            $delegate(exception, cause);
            var errorData = {
                exception: exception,
                cause: cause
            };
            /**
             * Could add the error to a service's collection,
             * add errors to $rootScope, log errors to remote web server,
             * or log locally. Or throw hard. It is entirely up to you.
             * throw exception;
             */
            toastr.error(exception.msg, errorData);
        };
    }
    ```

### Exception Catchers
###### [Style [Y111](#style-y111)]

  - Create a factory that exposes an interface to catch and gracefully handle exceptions.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to catch exceptions that may be thrown in your code (e.g. during XHR calls or promise failures).

    Note: The exception catcher is good for catching and reacting to specific exceptions from calls that you know may throw one. For example, when making an XHR call to retrieve data from a remote web service and you want to catch any exceptions from that service and react uniquely.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    angular
        .module('blocks.exception')
        .factory('exception', exception);

    exception.$inject = ['logger'];

    function exception(logger) {
        var service = {
            catcher: catcher
        };
        return service;

        function catcher(message) {
            return function(reason) {
                logger.error(message, reason);
            };
        }
    }
    ```

### Route Errors
###### [Style [Y112](#style-y112)]

  - Handle and log all routing errors using [`$routeChangeError`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/service/$route#$routeChangeError).

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to handle all routing errors.

    *Why?*: Potentially provides a better user experience if a routing error occurs and you route them to a friendly screen with more details or recovery options.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    var handlingRouteChangeError = false;

    function handleRoutingErrors() {
        /**
         * Route cancellation:
         * On routing error, go to the dashboard.
         * Provide an exit clause if it tries to do it twice.
         */
        $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeError',
            function(event, current, previous, rejection) {
                if (handlingRouteChangeError) { return; }
                handlingRouteChangeError = true;
                var destination = (current && (current.title ||
                    current.name || current.loadedTemplateUrl)) ||
                    'unknown target';
                var msg = 'Error routing to ' + destination + '. ' +
                    (rejection.msg || '');

                /**
                 * Optionally log using a custom service or $log.
                 * (Don't forget to inject custom service)
                 */
                logger.warning(msg, [current]);

                /**
                 * On routing error, go to another route/state.
                 */
                $location.path('/');

            }
        );
    }
    ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**


### Modules
###### [Style [Y127](#style-y127)]

  - When there are multiple modules, the main module file is named `app.module.js` while other dependent modules are named after what they represent. For example, an admin module is named `admin.module.js`. The respective registered module names would be `app` and `admin`.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency for multiple module apps, and for expanding to large applications.

    *Why?*: Provides easy way to use task automation to load all module definitions first, then all other angular files (for bundling).

### Configuration
###### [Style [Y128](#style-y128)]

  - Separate configuration for a module into its own file named after the module. A configuration file for the main `app` module is named `app.config.js` (or simply `config.js`). A configuration for a module named `admin.module.js` is named `admin.config.js`.

    *Why?*: Separates configuration from module definition, components, and active code.

    *Why?*: Provides an identifiable place to set configuration for a module.

### Routes
###### [Style [Y129](#style-y129)]

  - Separate route configuration into its own file. Examples might be `app.route.js` for the main module and `admin.route.js` for the `admin` module. Even in smaller apps I prefer this separation from the rest of the configuration.


### Layout
###### [Style [Y151](#style-y151)]

  - Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named `layout`. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.

    *Why?*: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.


### Testing Library
###### [Style [Y191](#style-y191)]

  - Use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for unit testing.

    *Why?*: Jasmine is widely used in the Angular community. Both are stable, well maintained, and provide robust testing features.

### Test Runner
###### [Style [Y192](#style-y192)]

  - Use [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) as a test runner.

    *Why?*: Karma is easy to configure to run once or automatically when you change your code.

    *Why?*: Karma hooks into your Continuous Integration process easily on its own or through Grunt or Gulp.

    *Why?*: Some IDE's are beginning to integrate with Karma, such as [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Visual Studio](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/02f47876-0e7a-4f6c-93f8-1af5d5189225).

    *Why?*: Karma works well with task automation leaders such as [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) (with [grunt-karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/grunt-karma)) and [Gulp](http://www.gulpjs.com). When using Gulp, use [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) directly and not with a plugin as the API can be called directly.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */

    // Gulp example with Karma directly
    function startTests(singleRun, done) {
        var child;
        var excludeFiles = [];
        var fork = require('child_process').fork;
        var karma = require('karma').server;
        var serverSpecs = config.serverIntegrationSpecs;

        if (args.startServers) {
            log('Starting servers');
            var savedEnv = process.env;
            savedEnv.NODE_ENV = 'dev';
            savedEnv.PORT = 8888;
            child = fork(config.nodeServer);
        } else {
            if (serverSpecs && serverSpecs.length) {
                excludeFiles = serverSpecs;
            }
        }

        karma.start({
            configFile: __dirname + '/karma.conf.js',
            exclude: excludeFiles,
            singleRun: !!singleRun
        }, karmaCompleted);

        ////////////////

        function karmaCompleted(karmaResult) {
            log('Karma completed');
            if (child) {
                log('shutting down the child process');
                child.kill();
            }
            if (karmaResult === 1) {
                done('karma: tests failed with code ' + karmaResult);
            } else {
                done();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Stubbing and Spying
###### [Style [Y193](#style-y193)]

  - Use [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for stubbing and spying.

    *Why?*: Sinon works well with both Jasmine and extends the stubbing and spying features they offer.

    *Why?*: Sinon makes it easier to toggle between Jasmine and Mocha, if you want to try both.

    *Why?*: Sinon has descriptive messages when tests fail the assertions.

### Headless Browser
###### [Style [Y194](#style-y194)]

  - Use [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) to run your tests on a server.

    *Why?*: PhantomJS is a headless browser that helps run your tests without needing a "visual" browser. So you do not have to install Chrome, Safari, IE, or other browsers on your server.

    Note: You should still test on all browsers in your environment, as appropriate for your target audience.

### Code Analysis
###### [Style [Y195](#style-y195)]

  - Run JSHint on your tests.

    *Why?*: Tests are code. JSHint can help identify code quality issues that may cause the test to work improperly.

### Alleviate Globals for JSHint Rules on Tests
###### [Style [Y196](#style-y196)]

  - Relax the rules on your test code to allow for common globals such as `describe` and `expect`. Relax the rules for expressions, as Mocha uses these.

    *Why?*: Your tests are code and require the same attention and code quality rules as all of your production code. However, global variables used by the testing framework, for example, can be relaxed by including this in your test specs.

    ```javascript
    /* jshint -W117, -W030 */
    ```
    Or you can add the following to your JSHint Options file.

    ```javascript
    "jasmine": true,
    "mocha": true,
    ```

  ![Testing Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/assets/testing-tools.png)

### Organizing Tests
###### [Style [Y197](#style-y197)]

  - Place unit test files (specs) side-by-side with your client code. Place specs that cover server integration or test multiple components in a separate `tests` folder.

    *Why?*: Unit tests have a direct correlation to a specific component and file in source code.

    *Why?*: It is easier to keep them up to date since they are always in sight. When coding whether you do TDD or test during development or test after development, the specs are side-by-side and never out of sight nor mind, and thus more likely to be maintained which also helps maintain code coverage.

    *Why?*: When you update source code it is easier to go update the tests at the same time.

    *Why?*: Placing them side-by-side makes it easy to find them and easy to move them with the source code if you move the source.

    *Why?*: Having the spec nearby makes it easier for the source code reader to learn how the component is supposed to be used and to discover its known limitations.

    *Why?*: Separating specs so they are not in a distributed build is easy with grunt or gulp.

    ```
    /src/client/app/customers/customer-detail.controller.js
                             /customer-detail.controller.spec.js
                             /customers.controller.js
                             /customers.controller.spec.js
                             /customers.module.js
                             /customers.route.js
                             /customers.route.spec.js
    ```



### animate.css
###### [Style [Y212](#style-y212)]

  - Use [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for conventional animations.

    *Why?*: The animations that animate.css provides are fast, smooth, and easy to add to your application.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency in your animations.

    *Why?*: animate.css is widely used and tested.

    Note: See this [great post by Matias Niemelä on Angular animations](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/08/remastered-animation-in-angularjs-1-2.html)


## Comments

### jsDoc
###### [Style [Y220](#style-y220)]

  - If planning to produce documentation, use [`jsDoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) syntax to document function names, description, params and returns. Use `@namespace` and `@memberOf` to match your app structure.

    *Why?*: You can generate (and regenerate) documentation from your code, instead of writing it from scratch.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency using a common industry tool.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Logger Factory
     * @namespace Factories
     */
    (function() {
      angular
          .module('app')
          .factory('logger', logger);

      /**
       * @namespace Logger
       * @desc Application wide logger
       * @memberOf Factories
       */
      function logger($log) {
          var service = {
             logError: logError
          };
          return service;

          ////////////

          /**
           * @name logError
           * @desc Logs errors
           * @param {String} msg Message to log
           * @returns {String}
           * @memberOf Factories.Logger
           */
          function logError(msg) {
              var loggedMsg = 'Error: ' + msg;
              $log.error(loggedMsg);
              return loggedMsg;
          };

## Constants

### Vendor Globals
###### [Style [Y240](#style-y240)]

  - Create an Angular Constant for vendor libraries' global variables.

    *Why?*: Provides a way to inject vendor libraries that otherwise are globals. This improves code testability by allowing you to more easily know what the dependencies of your components are (avoids leaky abstractions). It also allows you to mock these dependencies, where it makes sense.

    ```javascript
    // constants.js

    /* global toastr:false, moment:false */
    (function() {
        'use strict';

        angular
            .module('app.core')
            .constant('toastr', toastr)
            .constant('moment', moment);
    })();
    ```

###### [Style [Y241](#style-y241)]

  - Use constants for values that do not change and do not come from another service. When constants are used only for a module that may be reused in multiple applications, place constants in a file per module named after the module. Until this is required, keep constants in the main module in a `constants.js` file.

    *Why?*: A value that may change, even infrequently, should be retrieved from a service so you do not have to change the source code. For example, a url for a data service could be placed in a constants but a better place would be to load it from a web service.

    *Why?*: Constants can be injected into any angular component, including providers.

    *Why?*: When an application is separated into modules that may be reused in other applications, each stand-alone module should be able to operate on its own including any dependent constants.

    ```javascript
    // Constants used by the entire app
    angular
        .module('app.core')
        .constant('moment', moment);

    // Constants used only by the sales module
    angular
        .module('app.sales')
        .constant('events', {
            ORDER_CREATED: 'event_order_created',
            INVENTORY_DEPLETED: 'event_inventory_depleted'
        });
    ```

## Routing
Client-side routing is important for creating a navigation flow between views and composing views that are made of many smaller templates and directives.

###### [Style [Y270](#style-y270)]

  - Use the [AngularUI Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/) for client-side routing.

    *Why?*: UI Router offers all the features of the Angular router plus a few additional ones including nested routes and states.

    *Why?*: The syntax is quite similar to the Angular router and is easy to migrate to UI Router.

  - Note: You can use a provider such as the `routerHelperProvider` shown below to help configure states across files, during the run phase.

    ```javascript
    // customers.routes.js
    angular
        .module('app.customers')
        .run(appRun);

    /* @ngInject */
    function appRun(routerHelper) {
        routerHelper.configureStates(getStates());
    }

    function getStates() {
        return [
            {
                state: 'customer',
                config: {
                    abstract: true,
                    template: '<ui-view class="shuffle-animation"/>',
                    url: '/customer'
                }
            }
        ];
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    // routerHelperProvider.js
    angular
        .module('blocks.router')
        .provider('routerHelper', routerHelperProvider);

    routerHelperProvider.$inject = ['$locationProvider', '$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider'];
    /* @ngInject */
    function routerHelperProvider($locationProvider, $stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
        /* jshint validthis:true */
        this.$get = RouterHelper;

        $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);

        RouterHelper.$inject = ['$state'];
        /* @ngInject */
        function RouterHelper($state) {
            var hasOtherwise = false;

            var service = {
                configureStates: configureStates,
                getStates: getStates
            };

            return service;

            ///////////////

            function configureStates(states, otherwisePath) {
                states.forEach(function(state) {
                    $stateProvider.state(state.state, state.config);
                });
                if (otherwisePath && !hasOtherwise) {
                    hasOtherwise = true;
                    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise(otherwisePath);
                }
            }

            function getStates() { return $state.get(); }
        }
    }
    ```

###### [Style [Y271](#style-y271)]

  - Define routes for views in the module where they exist. Each module should contain the routes for the views in the module.

    *Why?*: Each module should be able to stand on its own.

    *Why?*: When removing a module or adding a module, the app will only contain routes that point to existing views.

    *Why?*: This makes it easy to enable or disable portions of an application without concern over orphaned routes.

## Task Automation
Use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for creating automated tasks.  Gulp leans to code over configuration while Grunt leans to configuration over code. I personally prefer Gulp as I feel it is easier to read and write, but both are excellent.

> Learn more about gulp and patterns for task automation in my [Gulp Pluralsight course](http://jpapa.me/gulpps)

###### [Style [Y400](#style-y400)]

  - Use task automation to list module definition files `*.module.js` before all other application JavaScript files.

    *Why?*: Angular needs the module definitions to be registered before they are used.

    *Why?*: Naming modules with a specific pattern such as `*.module.js` makes it easy to grab them with a glob and list them first.

    ```javascript
    var clientApp = './src/client/app/';

    // Always grab module files first
    var files = [
      clientApp + '**/*.module.js',
      clientApp + '**/*.js'
    ];
    ```
